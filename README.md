### [RO + RP-1] kOS Script Collection
Very basic early game scrips can be found in /basics

In-Flight data as well as the Telemetry viewer is in /logs

The current save-game I play during my streams (including all the craft files) is /saves/strim

More advanced scripts (using templating and dynamic imports) are the rest.
